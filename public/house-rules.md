# House Rules

Since this is _my_ blog, I run it under _my_ house rules. Firstly, the repo that contains all this code and content is governed by a simple [code of conduct](https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT).

I _do_ moderate my comments. I'm all for conversations that are controversial and create discussion. I won't remove comments that disagree with things I've said, or things other commenters have said.

However, I _will_ remove comments that are inflammatory, rude or trolling. I've only had a few handful of these, but in most cases I will apply a blanket blacklist to the account.

This is my blog. I chose what to publish here. If you really want to troll me, do it on your own blog.

Otherwise, thanks for stopping by.
