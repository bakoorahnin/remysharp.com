# Sorting Algorithms Visualized

There's been many (many!) visualised sorting algos before, but this is particularly enjoyable - and beautiful a number of different algorithms are used to sort colour (a problem that's hard by itself).

Really interesting stuff, but also reminds me that picking an algorithms that suits the dataset is an important consideration.
