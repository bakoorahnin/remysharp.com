# The Deno Manual

With the release of Deno 1.0 it's time to take a look at this familiar language but new runtime for JavaScript on the server.

What I was particularly interested in is that style guide in the manual that puts forth some really nice and straight forward ideas for good, stable code, and it almost points out the weak points of Node.js with statements such as:
