# How is "nodemon" pronounced?

I love making tools (that keep out of your way). Nodemon turns 10 years old this year and this thread on reddit was sent my way.

It's been a long running question (and joke) as to how nodemon is actually pronounced:

> node mon, no demon or nod√©mon (like pokemon)

I'm rather enjoying the replies :)
