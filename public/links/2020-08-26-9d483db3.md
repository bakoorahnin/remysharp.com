# Lea Verou's outline trick

This one line of CSS solves the problem of a focus ring appearing when the mouse interacts (visually annoying) whilst importantly **keeping** it for keyboard navigation:

    
    :focus:not(:focus-visible) { outline: none; }
    
    

Nice and simple, and bookmarking because I've been using it in more and more projects.
