# Progress Delayed Is Progress Denied

My short interpretation of Alex Russell's post (or certainly in my mind):

*   Apple have a monopoly
    
*   Safari, for over a decade now, been way way behind
    
*   Safari is not a modern browser - this is literally what devs and designers complained about IE6 for years.
    

Still, read Alex's post - it's packed full of data (as usual) and draws a clear conclusion that Apple, again, are delaying progress for the world wide web.
