# Indexing Outbound Blog Links

I really like this idea and more power to those of us who have full control of our online identities.

> ...an idea struck me: what if I could see all the outbound links on my blog?

I'm using markdown-it (where as Jim Nielsen is using marked) so I can definitely hook into the parser to generate all my outbound links.

I'll be adding this to my blog shortly - very clever.
