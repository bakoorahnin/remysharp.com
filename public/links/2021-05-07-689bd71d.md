# Why you shouldn't use ENV variables for secret data

This is an interesting and compelling post about using ENV values for secrets - something I do almost exclusively.

The only (big) problem I run into is that the solution offered is to use "docker secrets" which, for the vast majority of my own work isn't something that's available (I don't use docker for my development or deployments).

It makes me wonder, is there a _simple_ alternative for those non-docker devs ðŸ¤”
