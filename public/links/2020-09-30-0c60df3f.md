# Package Diff

Title is a bit misleading, but this tool gives a _complete_ diff of the changes between versions.

This is especially useful when you want to vet a potential upgrade to a core package in a project, to understand what and why.

Or equally to look at a vulnerability fix to learn from the changes.
