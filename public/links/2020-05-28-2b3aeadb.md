# The first computer program in BASIC ran OTD in 1964

As BASIC returns to my radar, this was a bit of lovely timing on Twitter lately:

> The first computer program in BASIC ran OTD in 1964. The language was designed by John Kemeny, Thomas Kurtz and Sister Mary Kenneth Keller.
> She, the next year, was the first US woman to earn a PhD in computer science.

The program:

```
10 PRINT 2+2
20 END
```

I love learning about these pockets of history.
