# 5 most annoying website features I face as a blind person every single day

This is a short list of some of the easiest things to fix for us developers and designers and is, what I'd call, bread and butter of our work.

This is the kind of article that needs to be shared amongst our colleagues so that they see the impact of sloppy/quick coding that results in a poor user experience. And again: this list of 5 items are _incredibly_ simple to do right.

Let's build a web for everyone.
