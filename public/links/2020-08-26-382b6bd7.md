# Simple 8-bit Assembler Simulator in Javascript

Really interesting assembly simulator, both from the simplicity of the UX (I believe it's based on the 6502) but also the source code is fairly easy to reason with.

I also like the visualisation of registers and memory during each step - very useful to learn from.
