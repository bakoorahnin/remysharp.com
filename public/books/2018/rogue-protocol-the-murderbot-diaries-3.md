As usual from the MurderBot series: excellent, fresh and entertaining.  
  
I felt like the story dug deeper into MurderBot's character, anxiety and it's attempt to understand it's feelings.  
  
Definitely feels like this third book is pulling together an overarching story that will be concluded in book four - which I can't wait to read!
