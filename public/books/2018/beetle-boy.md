I read this aloud to my son at bedtime (6 turning 7 in a month). It took a chunk of time, and making the voices distinct was fun and tricky!  
  
I asked him to give me the review, so the 5 stars is his (I'd have given it 4, but the book was for him).

Boy called Darkus found a beetle and had 2 friends, blew up the emporium, and got his dad back and Lauretta Cutter got away.  
  
I liked them building Basecamp.
