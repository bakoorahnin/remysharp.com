Really enjoyed this thriller. An easy read and natural page turner (with nice short chapters). I was also drawn to this book because I know Brighton (UK) very very well, and I love reading stories located in places that are familiar to me.  
  
The story is a solid thriller and paced really well, and a great read for a holiday (I powered through it over 2 days).  
  
I really loved how (somehow, I'm not sure quite how), the author, Koomson managed to take the character Macy and make me firstly dislike her and get annoyed with the character, then whilst getting frustrated with her, start to understand her and feel compassion towards her, and by the end see strength in her that was always there, just revealed perfectly at the pace the story needed. Surprising stuff üëç
