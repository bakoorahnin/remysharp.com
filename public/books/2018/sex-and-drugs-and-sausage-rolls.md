Fun stuff. I didn't realise this was the sixth novel of a series, but it really didn't matter - and almost added more depth since the characters had a lot more backstory.  
  
Robert Rankin's writing is really fun too. Lots of quick wit throughout the book, the kind that I wish I could come up with in my daily life!  
  
The story is a kind of comical farce whereby history has somehow shifted and things aren't quite what they're supposed to be.  
  
I'm not quite sure if the story is supposed to have a single protagonist or whether it's more of an ensemble. It certainly _mostly_ follows Jim, John and Soap (greatâ€¦weird, name!). Then there's multiple side characters that I half suspect might have more story in other Brentwood books.  
  
All the same, it was really fun to read a book that clearly had a wide range of characters with more stories to tell.
