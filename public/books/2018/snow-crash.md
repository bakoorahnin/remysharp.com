(warning: not really a review, more of a thing to remind me of the book)  
  
Overall, a fairly cinematic story akin to the genre I'd expect The Matrix to fall into. If I'm completely honest, I did occasionally lose track of what was going on through the story (it took me a good few weeks to read it), but the story and two main characters managed to carry me along.  
  
I also have to admit that it took me a little while to get past the corny named main character "Hiro Protagonist" and the overly macho techno all black, motorcycles and swords. Of course, Hiro is the world's best swordsman…obviously. Though when I just went with it, it was pretty good fun.  
  
Neal Stephenson writing was extremely good at visualising a scene and the objects in the world the characters live in (in reading the acknowledgement I learnt that the book was intended as a graphic novel and I wonder if there was graphic work he was describing). All the same, it was very easy to read and see the world as we moved from reality, to the metaverse (virtual world), to vehicles and different landscapes.  
  
There's a tonne of historical and religious background to the story too, most of which I understand to be based on real research (from our universe) and the depth of which was incredible.  
  
The Snow Crash is (supposed to be) a virus that exists in both the digital world and the real world. The story creates (perhaps tenuous?) links between computer/digital ideas and pre-biblical times explaining that the story of Babel was the first instance of the virus, transmitted through verbal programming, affecting humankind.  
  
The two other main-ish characters were Y.T (a young women/teenager who we follow in parallel with Hiro) and Raven. Y.T. is really fun, and perhaps more relatable since she's a little more "regular" (compared with Hiro) - just kitted out with lots of tricks in her suit.  
  
Raven is the uber baddie, throwing glass spears, cutting through bulletproof suits and generally being invisible. He definitely plays the "main henchman" really well, and we even get to understand his motives which I love for a "proper" baddie.  
  
Overall, I enjoyed the book, left a little confused about the motivation about some of the connections in the book (like what really motivates Y.T. to join forces with Hiro, or how Hiro was one of the first creators of the metaverse, yet he's somehow a promotor for his roommate's band…).  
  
Sorry, not much of a review, more a prompt for my own memory in years to come!
