summary: "Couldn't get on with this book at all."

Couldn't get on with this book **at all**.

Got 20% the way through. Didn't care for the character at all. Felt like there was inconsistencies in his behaviour and I constantly felt like the story was nonsense. This left me utterly unengaged.

A big red flag for me was when we meet the first female character who is described only as "beautiful", "stunning", "sexy" etc (none of the male characters are described like this), and the description and indeed the female character serves no purpose to the story. I passed over this section (around 10% in I think), but the book just didn't work for me in the slightest.

Might work for you, didn't for me. This review is for my record only.
