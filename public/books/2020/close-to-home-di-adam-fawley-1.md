summary: "Solid reading, what I've come to expect from Hunter."

Solid reading, what I've come to expect from Hunter.  
  
Having now read three of the Adam Fawley books, albeit in reverse order, I've come to expect a certain level of story telling from Cara Hunter and this as the first book does not disappoint.  
  
Having recently read the 2nd book (though the order isn't crucial) the twist device was a little familiar but it didn't distract from the story, nor did I predict any part of the story.  
  
Enjoyable as a British based modern investigation story that leans more on (what I imagine is) police work rather than glamorous whodunit style reveals.  
  
Looking forward to reading the fourth installment.
