summary: "I literally have no idea what I read!"

I literally have no idea what I read!

This is far from any kind of review. I just finished the book but I really don't know what I read, or even if there was a story.

It was certainly well told, with weaving and turns and hand offs between characters but I couldn't tell you what it was about.

The Russian names definitely gave me trouble and the author really didn't like to refer to characters by a single constant name (which added to my getting confused).

I do like that I enjoy the Rolling Stones' _Sympathy for the Devil_ - which was inspired (quite clearly) by this book.

The idea is appealing: the devil is bored in Moscow. But I'm fairly sure there's more to the story!
