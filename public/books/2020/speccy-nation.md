Fun writing but does end up being a game by game review.  
  
I've been taking long walks through nostalgia and revisiting my childhood days with the Spectrum, so this book looked fun.  
  
It's well written and Dan Whitehead has a fun way of writing - very much in the ilk of the spectrum games of the day. There's a briefish introduction to the history of the spectrum that I had wished there was more and then the book goes through some of the poignant games from the 80s that ran on the speccy.  
  
The game chapters weren't so much as reviews but a dig into what made the games interesting either from the player's perspective or a technical achievement for the day.  
  
I would have preferred more stories from the history of the speccy, but that I guess is an entirely different book.  
  
Still, a fun read, some bookmark worthy game titles with some useful web resources at the end.
