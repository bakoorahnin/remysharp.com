Loved it. I happened to read this directly after the '86 Fix, and although it didn't have the same "retro" feel of the first book, it was superb all the same.  
  
Some parts of the storyline were actually quite bleak, with the hard reflective thoughts that go with "what if" - I really enjoyed this.  
  
It ties up a bit overly perfectly at the end, but after following Craig across the two books, and all the hardships he goes through, I was actually quite see Craig have a happy ending!
