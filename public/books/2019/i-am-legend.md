I loved it; gripping, heart warming, shameful, despairing, brilliant and quite beautiful.  
  
I'd seen the film some years ago and knew it was based on the book but had heard it diverged from the book a lot in the end. But wow, the book was a different beast.  
  
The story centres around Robert Neville, the last man alive in a world of vampires and undead.  
  
He's surviving, but for what he doesn't know. The story doesn't hold back to expose his awful constant sexual frustration and how, somehow, rape is normalised to him.  
  
His survival is bleak and he knows it. He's constantly asking why he continues and fights for his sanity whilst every single night he barricades himself in his home whilst the undead come calling at his door.  
  
Brilliantly written, brilliant story and I only wish it was longer.  
  
When I read the last line of the book, I broke into a smile. Such a good story that holds up so well after being written in 1954.
