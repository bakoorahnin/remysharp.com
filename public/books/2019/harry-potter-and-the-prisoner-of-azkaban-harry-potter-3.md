I read this to my son, who turned 7 just after we started. We did end up doing some epic bedtime reading sessions to complete whole chapters. And as with books I've read to him, I shall let his own words dictate this review :)

I liked the bit where Harry goes underground and in the house, because I wish I had a scary house under the whomping willow.  
  
When Black came into the room, I thought it was scary, and I thought it was going to happen in my bedroom!  
  
The sad bit was when Buckbeak died (but oh yeah, they rescued him).  
  
It's good, and a little bit scary.
