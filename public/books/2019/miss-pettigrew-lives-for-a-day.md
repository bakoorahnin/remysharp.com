All throughout reading this book, I found myself smiling.  
  
This book was published in 1938 and tells the tale of Miss Pettigrew, a failing governess who's life thus far has been quiet, polite and "ladylike", but, as the title gives away, this day, she lives.  
  
I've never before read a book that I've non-stop smiled whilst reading.  
  
I found myself falling quickly in love with Miss Pettigrew and wanting her to have all the kindness she deserved.
