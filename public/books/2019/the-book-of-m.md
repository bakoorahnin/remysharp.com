Engaging from the very first pages, brilliant writing and ideas with some sci-fi without the need to explain absolutely everything. Loved it.  
  
If I'm honest the title is what attracted me to the book and I had hoped it would be a brilliant read - and it absolutely was!  
  
The story kicks off immediately into the first few pages where people have start to lose their shadows, and the knock on effect is that they forget, they forget all sorts of things, then they forget their name, or forget their parent's names, or that they had a husband or wife or children, then forget how to speak. Then more mind bendingly, they forget that a thing is a thing, an in doing so reality changes around them - such as forgetting that a place exists then all of a sudden that place really doesn't exist taking all it's inhabitants with it.  
  
The story follows a few key characters dedicating chapters to telling each of their story and the effect this epidemic (of sorts) affects their lives. So the story is very much about humans even though it lives inside an almost magical epidemic.  
  
I like that the story doesn't particularly try to explain how the shadows are lost or why and why it affects some people faster than others.  
  
A wonderfully written book that swept me along. Definitely recommend.
