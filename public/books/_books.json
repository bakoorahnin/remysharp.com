    "review": "A well told tale of magic and adventure. And more of a starting point for its movie counterpart<br /><i></i><br />The Stardust film is amongst one of my favourite of the modern films I've watched in my lifetime, and so I've seen the film a number of times and know it well. I was a little wary of pre-expectations but the novel did well to bring something new to the story of Stardust.<br /><br />However, since the movie is so close to me, there's no other way for me to review the book other than in context of the movie (sorry to those who haven't seen or read either).<br /><br />I will say I still probably enjoy the movie more (but movies are my jam _and_ the movie got my affections first). However, the book on it's own merits is also really quite good.<br /><br />The novel follows the movie (or rather the movie followed the novel) fairly closely for the 2/3rds of the story but the movie diverges significantly from the book for the ending, perhaps going for a wilder ending with more \"movie going climax\". The book ends more in a way that wonders out into the sunset with a tidy, but kind, epilogue.<br /><br />I can't honestly say whether the novel is split into acts (as a movie might be), but we follow Tristran Thorn as he promises to return a fallen star in exchange for \"what his heart desires\" of Victoria.<br /><br />The prices of Stormhold are off to retrieve the topaz the 81st Lord of Stormhold threw into the night sky (inadvertently knocking Yvaine out of the sky) to claim their position on the throne of Storhold.<br /><br />Whilst at the same time, The Lilim, three witches, get wind of the fallen star and send out the Witch Queen to retrieve her heart to bring them back to their young.<br /><br />The story, in novel form, is a sort of travelling adventure slow moving story through the magical world of Faerie (which I'm sure I've read before in a Gaiman book…). In retrospect it does feel like some of the supporting characters are a little sidelined and certainly (probably because of the movie) expected more from the Witch Queen.<br /><br />But a nicely told tale all the same (except perhaps when the Witch Queen slices off the head of a Unicorn that's already had a spike rammed through it's eye socket!).",

I'm pretty familiar with 8-bit assembly already but this helped to lay some decent foundations.<br /><br />The pace is a bit weird though. It starts and continues for a good deal of the book as uber simple, almost erring on the side of being patronising with it's weird 16 fingered alien - but it does just about work.<br /><br />But then, as the later chapters go on, the author suddenly switches from nice and gentle to \"obviously\", \"just\" and \"simple\" and it feels a bit like you're tossed into the deep end with no orientation. I found I had to re-read seemingly short and \"obvious\" chapters.<br /><br />Frustratingly the chapters on audio and graphics were exceptionally short only referring to the `out` ports which is technically accurate but didn't offer much advice.<br /><br />Then around 40% of the book is used to build out a Frogger clone which I'll admit I skimmed.<br /><br />The appendix is very useful though, with a complete index of opcode to pneumonic and visa versa which I've used a number of times already.",

    "review": "The hate crimes make this for brutal reading, but, as always, incredible engaging.<br /><i></i><br />I'm not big on book series. I'm not big on police crime novels. And yet I've read all the books that Cara Hunter has released, all of which from the same police characters and all linking to each other (although I managed to read them as 3, 2, 1, 4!).<br /><br />Hunter's writing is solid, well paced and doesn't give away where it's really going to go. The characters are all well drawn and motivated and I'm looking forward to buying her 5th publication.<br /><br />Perhaps because I read the Adam Fawley books in reverse order, and therefore the arcs are backwards, but \"All the Rage\" definitely ramps up the brutality of the crime. This book starts out with, what's suspected as a hate crime.<br /><br />It's this initial hate crime that feels so ugly and disturbing that initially I wasn't so sure I was enjoying the book (or rather I might have elected to stop reading). The reason it's so disturbing is partly because of our current social climate but also because I have friends who have been at the sharp end of similar kinds of hate crimes.<br /><br />I carried on and it's a good read and definitely engaging. I did also enjoy that although the main book character is (or feels like it is) Adam Fawley, there's definitely a sense that this piece belongs to the women in the story as they drive the story forward and rise up to the various challenges.<br /><br />Although this story can easily stand on it's own (I mention it's a series, but there's no required reading), I do think that having more character backstory and context has helped my own engagement in these characters.<br /><br />Suffice to say: good stuff. Definitely recommend if you like these types of novels.",

    "review": "This is a hard book to read, partly for the confused start, but also the very real ending. A deep insight into clinical depression.<br /><i></i><br />I have to admit that in reading this book I really struggled to enjoy it - and not because it of the nature of the book, but because it felt like I was bouncing around inside of Sylvia Plath's head in a random jumbled up, non linear fashion.<br /><br />In fact, I'd say the first third of the book is almost entirely that. The mini stories that occur don't really finish, and as we were journeying through one recounted story, I'd find we'd quickly make a sharp turn and begin a new journey.<br /><br />The middle third starts to become a bit more pieced together but the book was struggling to win me over. Esther Greenwood (which I'd read earlier The Bell Jar was semi-autobiographical) wanted to kill herself. The way that this third goes on read almost childish and, for my shame, I was beginning to hope the character \"just get on with it\". <br /><br />It was also that the first section of the book painted an extremely successful character and the character in the second part was very much the opposite end of the spectrum and the different was jarring and hard to consolidate (as a reader).<br /><br />Suffice to say, she does indeed attempt suicide. For the final third of the book she is institutionalised and undergoes therapy but also electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The ECT isn't glorified nor is it vilified which was interesting and challenging (particularly with the story being semi-autobiographical).<br /><br />The last third takes its time and walks gently through the journey that she takes during her institutionalised. None of this part of the book is glamourised and she doesn't make some magical recovery. <br /><br />It's slow, gentle and unsure. Even as Esther finally reaches her board review to see if she can leave the institution, she herself is unconvinced that anything has changed, but something is certainly at rest in her.<br /><br />The last part of the book definitely calls for reflection and helped to give me an insight into those who struggle with existing. There's rarely some grand purpose that drives them to death by suicide, and indeed in Esther's case there's nothing that particularly explain _why_ she wanted to end her life. <br /><br />There's a moment with her medical supervisor where Esther says that she hates her mother. This is after their last encounter - and her mother isn't bad in the slightest, it's that her mother wants to know what she had done wrong to have not been able to help protect her daughter from these feelings. The supervisor (slash therapist) says, \"I believe you do\". She doesn't try to sympathies or give Esther another point of view. This line surprised me, in a believable way.<br /><br />And as the book ends, Esther is reunited with her mother, and her mother, naively says she just wants to forget about it all and move forward from this, healthier time. To which Esther writes that her mother may want to forget and that perhaps Esther might forget those feelings:<br /><br />&gt; Maybe forgetfulness, like a kind snow, should numb and cover them. But they were part of me. They were my landscape.<br /><br />Having dealings with depression myself, and shock grief of the worst kind, it really doesn't go away, and it isn't forgotten. It's as Plath writes: it becomes part of your landscape.<br /><br />---<br /><br />This is a hard book to read, partly for the confused start, but also the very real ending. Made harder by knowing that Sylvia Plath died by suicide the same year of this book's release. <br /><br />Plath described the book (to her mother) as:<br /><br />&gt; a pot boiler really, but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown.<br /><br />Indeed that's the experience of the last third of the book.",

Na een stage wordt Esther afgewezen voor haar eerste baan en trekt ze weer bij haar moeder in. Daar verzinkt ze gaandeweg in een diepe depressie totdat opname in een psychiatrische kliniek de enige uitweg lijkt. In januari 2019 verscheen bij Faber &amp; Faber in London voor het eerst het korte verhaal \"Mary Ventura en het negende koninkrijk'. Sylvia Plath schreef dit verhaal toen ze studeerde, maar het werd pas zeer recentelijk teruggevonden. De Bezige Bij voegt het verhaal toe aan de nieuwe uitgave van De glazen stolp.<br /><br />De glazen stolp (The bell jar) verscheen voor het eerst in 1963, vlak daarna pleegde Plath zelfmoord… Het werd in het Nederlands vertaald door René Kurpershoek in 1981, dit is ondertussen al de 7de druk. Speciaal voor deze versie werd ook het kortverhaal ‘Mary Ventura en het negende koninkrijk’ toegevoegd. Een goede reden om ook deze druk in huis te halen. En de fans van de poëzie van Sylvia (ik) moeten ook zeker dit boek kopen.<br /><br />De glazen stolp is een klassieker die alom, geheel terecht, geroemd wordt. Plath schrijft hyperrealistisch (het voelt ook nog steeds hedendaags aan) én bevreemdend. Ze schrijft pijnlijk trefzeker, ontziet niets of niemand, heeft oog voor het kleinste detail én bezit een geweldig gevoel voor humor. <br /><br />Esther Greenwood (de hoofdpersoon) en haar ambities, haar dromen, de mallemolen in haar hoofd die draait en draait,… Plath laat je moeiteloos meevoelen, meeleven en, bijna, begrijpen hoe het voelt om Esther te zijn. <br /><br />Wie is er gek en wie niet? Waar ligt de grens, wie bepaalt de norm? Meer dan 50 jaar na het verschijnen van dit boek is het voor (jonge) vrouwen nog steeds niet evident om ongeremd anders te zijn, gewoon zichzelf te zijn. Een eigen koers varen, wars van etiketten en vastgeroeste wegwijzers blijft gevaarlijk. Daarom blijft dit boek verplichte kost voor elke vrouw die meer wil zijn dan het zoveelste schaap in de kudde."

There's a lot of references to prior adventures, characters, outcomes and learnings - which makes it hard to jump straight into this book (I wouldn't recommend doing so actually).<br /><br />However, I _have_ read all the prior novellas and was able to pick up from where I left off, and SecUnit continues to be lovable, grumpy and extremely uncomfortable with emotions.<br /><br />What was a real delight was the return of ART. We met ART in _Artificial Condition_ (book 2) and I remember being disappointed that we didn't meet it again, but in this story, ART plays a main character - and it's beautiful. <br /><br />I do also love how Wells writes about these characters. Firstly they're respectful of pronouns - somehow whenever I've thought of a robot, I've referred to them as \"he\" yet robots have no gender. Wells makes it pretty clear that a) this has never been an issue to the constructs, and b) always makes sure we're using the right pronouns, including always referring to SecUnit's mushy clients as \"humans and augmented humans\".<br /><br />If you're a Murderbot fan, then I definitely think you'll enjoy this.

What if that creature were spiders? Well, this book will give you a good run for your money. <br /><br />Split, mostly, between a new civilization of sentient spiders and a space ark containing (what we presume) the last cargo of earthlings, the story tells itself over centuries, if not millennia (it's not really clear - just enough time for spiders to become astronauts!).<br /><br />On one side the story looks at an evolving species and dips in and out of time to see how they're getting on, how science evolves, how society evolves and most interestingly, struggles to break free of their DNA wiring. <br /><br />On the other side, floating away in space a space ark ship, run by \"key crew\" and carrying a cargo of the last dollop of humanity. Space sleep, stasis, what have you, is used to let the characters jump over centuries of time, and start to slip out of sync of eachother's ages. <br /><br />The responsibility of carry the last of humanity and even the sheer amount of time on a ship that was perhaps designed for shipping and not generations of the living are examined, and this is certainly interesting. <br /><br />The book, at 600 odd pages though, for me, took me a long, long time to get through. 2 months in fact. I found it really hard to feel any kind of connection with the spider society and evolution which probably dragged my reading along. <br /><br />I loved Dogs of War by the same author, and I legally remember it being quite epic. But with this book, it was beyond epic and around the 60% mark I was just wanting it to end.<br /><br />The end of the book does close off with some really nice and aspirational ideas, but for me, this just too long to get to and fell short of what felt like work to finish the book. <br /><br />Recommended if you like your space operas. Possibly pass if you're unsure. I'm not sure I'll be quick to pick up another book that spans an epic time period for a while!",

My star rating is based in context of \"Stories of your life and others\" which I know is unfair in some ways, but it's what it is. It's more 3.5 stars rather than 3.<br /><br />I found I was really craving some more lengthy stories from Exhalation and (I think) there were about four of the total short stories that gave me that. Although each story was inventive, amazing and beautiful, I kept feeling like the endings were falling short, or ending too soon…or maybe just giving up.<br /><br />\"The Lifecycle of Software Objects\" I thought approached some really interesting ideas and asked me, as a reader, to expand my mind and preconceptions of what _could be_, but the way it ended, I felt as if I'd missed something. It felt true to life in that it just ends without any big bang, but as a story, I wanted to come away satisfied, or shocked, or with some emotion, but it just … kinda ended.<br /><br />I think \"The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate\" was my favourite story and I loved the setting and the idea that the past can be revisited in the way described in the story.<br /><br />Exhalation is definitely a good book, but for me, it just didn't shine as brightly as Chiang's first collection (which was 5 stars).

In the epistolary ‘Exhalation’, an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications not just for his own people, but for all of reality. And in ‘The Lifecycle of Software Objects’, a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years, elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being. Also included are two brand-new stories: ‘Omphalos’ and ‘Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom’.</p><p>In <i>Exhalation</i>, Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth – What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human? – and ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.</p>"

The book uses the records of three characters' account to recount Gilead in it's more mature state.<br /><br />It's Aunt Lydia's account that I really enjoyed. The character in The Handmaid's Tale was pretty horrible and tricky to relate to, but I felt like the TV series somehow added a much more complex layer to Aunt Lydia and now The Testaments gives her a voice, and I love it.<br /><br />Aunt Linda tells of the time the Gilead comes into being and how she came to hold such a powerful position. <br /><br />What's particularly brutal and scary about The Testaments and the stories of Gilead's inception is how it skims so closely to our own reality with its own fear of the different and long time brewing of hatred, racism, sexism and homophobia. It doesn't take a great leap to see our own reality take a turn like this to result in a repressive state such as Gilead.<br /><br />The real only glimmer of hope is that, like The Handmaid's Tale, the story is being recounted in the future inside of an academic environment and lessons are to be learnt the same way we might study Nazi Germany. The Testaments has the same reflection and study of a society that has ended. <br /><br />The Testaments both looks at Gilead's time of creation but also it's downfall.<br /><br />I found the book to be a really enjoyable, challenging read. I also definitely benefitted having had The Handmaid's Tale in recent memory. I'd highly recommend.",

There's so much that this story had that I hold dearly to my heart and the story is woven with kindness, love and acceptance of others.<br /><br />I also loved the writing style that Becky Chambers has. I was quickly introduced not only to the characters, but to _their_ character and it was clear what was important to them and how the characters cared about each other.<br /><br />Another detail in their writing that I noticed and appreciated, was that the mundane aspects of the story, which could easily pad out a book or potentially offer a few interesting scenes - they were entirely omitted. The crew have a successful \"punch\" (creating a wormhole), and so they decided to head plant-side for some drinks and celebration - it's not in the book. We pick up the next morning. Back with our characters and _much more_ interesting exchanges happen. This happened a number of times and I personally found it refreshing that the story kept me connected to the characters.<br /><br />The story is set in some distant future where space is explored, species have connected and human kind have spread themselves across the galaxies. But really it's about people (I think), our connections, what makes family, what matters.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed that the bulk of the crew's journey was their story and that Chambers didn't throw in unnecessary suspense or tension. For me it make the characters and the world all that more real and believable.<br /><br />It was hard not to fall in love with the crew too, especially the \"core crew\", comprising of Kizzy and Jenks - the techheads, Sissex the super cool reptilian pilot, Dr Chef - a chef…and a doctor, and Ashby, the kind of captain and person that stands up for their crew and conducts and behaves in a way I wish I could all the time.<br /><br />Then there was the fact that Chamber's characters don't adhere to (I hate to say) \"normal\". The alien species approach family and sex differently. They approach gender and identity differently. They approach food and social situations differently. They read as believable and lovable because they're not just another carbon copy of the human archetype white male hero character.<br /><br />This book is full of hope and love and it was exactly what I needed in my life in 2020. I cannot wait to read the next books set in this world.<br /><br />I want these characters in my life and I miss them already.<br />",

      "description": "Follow a motley crew on an exciting journey through space—and one adventurous young explorer who discovers the meaning of family in the far reaches of the universe—in this light-hearted debut space opera from a rising sci-fi star.<br /><br />Rosemary Harper doesn’t expect much when she joins the crew of the aging Wayfarer. While the patched-up ship has seen better days, it offers her a bed, a chance to explore the far-off corners of the galaxy, and most importantly, some distance from her past. An introspective young woman who learned early to keep to herself, she’s never met anyone remotely like the ship’s diverse crew, including Sissix, the exotic reptilian pilot, chatty engineers Kizzy and Jenks who keep the ship running, and Ashby, their noble captain.<br /><br />Life aboard the Wayfarer is chaotic and crazy—exactly what Rosemary wants. It’s also about to get extremely dangerous when the crew is offered the job of a lifetime. Tunneling wormholes through space to a distant planet is definitely lucrative and will keep them comfortable for years. But risking her life wasn’t part of the plan. In the far reaches of deep space, the tiny Wayfarer crew will confront a host of unexpected mishaps and thrilling adventures that force them to depend on each other. To survive, Rosemary’s got to learn how to rely on this assortment of oddballs—an experience that teaches her about love and trust, and that having a family isn’t necessarily the worst thing in the universe."

Only the individual human mind remains immune to the sophons. This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a last-ditch defence that grants four individuals almost absolute power to design secret strategies, hidden through deceit and misdirection from Earth and Trisolaris alike. Three of the Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists, but the fourth is a total unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer, is baffled by his new status.

    "review": "Decent sci-fi read, not terribly challenging, perhaps a bit overly grim towards the end, but entertaining all round.<br /><i></i><br />After reading The Three Body Problem, I feel like sci-fi might be spoilt for me if it's not rooted deeply in hard science! Though Recursion does stem from a real world MIT experiment (amazingly) it's more akin to the romantic notion of sci-fi (if that's even a thing!).<br /><br />The book splits pretty cleanly into three phases: 1. setup and drama, 2. sci-fi, time travel, action, 3. world ending disaster and reconciliation.<br /><br />I felt like the first part was a little underwhelming, wondering where the story was going and what these two characters had to do with each other: Helena and Barry.<br /><br />Thankfully this is cleanly answered in the second part where some interesting ideas are at play: specifically being able to travel back to a memory and \"fork\" reality off into a new timeline. Though it's only mentioned briefly, it feels like this a nod to four dimensions.<br /><br />The last part when the characters decide they have to save the world - though apparently it's just down to one person not only being responsible for the end of the world but also be responsible for stopping it.<br /><br />The book does its best to tell some fairly horrific tales of how the world would end - though this is very American-centric, but as the characters are based in the states, I'd imagine this is because it's their point of view. The descriptions of skin melting off and sores and blisters and radiation burning and all of that is fairly graphic. I can't decide if it made this part of the story more harrowing or if it just felt grotesque.<br /><br />There's also large chunks of scenes where the protagonists are such incredible pain (the skin from a handprint peeling off and sticking to the walls) that I wondered how they were supposed to actually perform anything, instead of passing out from internal failure. But still, it's _just_ a story!<br /><br />Overall, a decent read, not super challenging and explored some \"fun\" ideas with time travel and the concepts of what reality might be.",

It’s why she’s dedicated her life to creating a technology that will let us preserve our most precious moments of our pasts.

These inquests have always been closed-doors and utterly opaque, and nearly always lays the fault on the human, so Libby gives us an inside view of what's going on.<br /><br />There's a \"Hacker\" who takes control of a number of cars and states that each Passenger will die in two hours time. It's then put to the jurors in the inquest to decide (along with a vote from the public - ala dystopian x-factor) as to which single individual will survive.<br /><br />Jack Larsson is an MP on the panel of jurors. He's horrid. I got the impression he was a Farage type character, disgustingly sexist, racist, self centred, the works. The author does a great job of keeping Larsson on character - as much as it was hard to read this character.<br /><br />What I had trouble with was how the Hacker had unprecedented control over not only *every single car* in the UK, but also what seemed like hundred of cameras inside the inquest. The hacker could turn off the audio from the passengers and somehow also kill their network reception on their phones (okay, maybe…) but why the passengers didn't resort to writing on a bit of paper to communicate…it seemed like (to me at least) an obvious tool to use.<br /><br />The hijacking story ends around 80% in the book which left me kind of confused as to what was coming next. The last of the book is split in half between 3 months later where Libby is the voice for an activist group and the 2 years later when (another) inquest into Jack Larsson's involvement.<br /><br />The end felt pretty jarring whilst also trying to clean up all the loose ends and (almost) quickly making sure all the baddies have their comeuppance (though in \"reality\" the real baddies get away scott free…).<br /><br />I think it makes a good holiday read, but not so well suited to my desire to read a clever dystopian view on near-future technology.",

North's writing style is pretty unique with half completed sentences and almost a stream of thought put down on the pages. It wouldn't seem to work, but it reads brilliantly.<br /><br />Hope Arden has a unique condition that she is forgotten. I loved that the book looked at the effect of being forgotten and the loneliness that goes hand in hand. There's also the practical impact of being forgotten such as medical treatment or anything requiring long term attention.<br /><br />The opening chapters explain Hope's early life and though the story is told from Hope being (I think) mid/late-30s, the times that she's forgotten by her family is truly heartbreaking - and that's _just_ the beginning!<br /><br />The first half of the book is pretty evenly paced, by which point I couldn't quite see how the story would end (it sort of has a half-ending in the middle), but then the story goes up several gears and races forward, twisting around questions of sanity and reality (if you're always forgotten, do you exist? Did they exist? What don't you know?).<br /><br />Definitely recommend.",

    "review": "I've read and enjoyed the previous two Clement stories. This story was fun, and a very easy read (for me to get through 400 pages in a matter of days is testament to that).<br /><br />The story follows a journalist, Emma in her mid-40s, living in London on her own and being handed crappy assignments, whilst she's still hungry for her big break.<br /><br />She comes across Clement (our 70s angel trying to - somehow - find redemption) and he's drawn to her knowing that he must help her in some way. Enter the Clawthorn Club and the story.<br /><br />Overall, the story is enjoyable, and it's nice to get a little into the feelings of Clement (having read the two previous installments). The story does have some predictable (to me) twists, but it doesn't hurt the reading experience too much.<br /><br />Sadly the author decided this was the book to push his own opinions about the current climate of how women are to take daily microaggressions. <br /><br />I understand that Clement's language and attitudes stem from the 60s and 70s which leads to some socially jarring language. This is what adds to Clement's charm, that when he's pulled up on the language be it \"casual\" racism or sexism he listens to the feedback and adjusts when appropriate. <br /><br />This book is different to the previous installments, as this story is sprinkled with the protagonist, Emma, casually putting down other women's own struggles. These times throughout the book don't contribute to the characters nor did it help the story along, so I sense this is more that the author is _shoehorning_ their own opinions in. Which served to annoy and frustrate me when I bumped into those random moments in the book.",

I asked for recommendations for Christmas–feelings books, and this is one that came up, and it does indeed do a good job of getting those feel–good vibes going.<br /><br />The story is a little sickly sweet, but that's okay. I particularly liked the first 1/4 of the story that follows Louise, an unexpected adopted mother to Hope. This part is particularly tender and gentle.<br /><br />The book definitely left me with the desire to follow the Christmas traditions that's created in the story, which as the book ends, it's followed by real life stories of individuals who did just that.<br /><br />I have the kindle version that, unbeknownst to me, included some twenty-odd true stories at the end, making up around 20% of the kindle edition. I read a few of these, but they did follow the same pattern, and eventually skipped over a few feeling it was similar to reading an appendix of a book (and yes, this makes me a little bit of a terrible person!!!).<br /><br />Overall: does the job I had hoped it would do: get me in the mood for Christmas by reminding me of the \"gift of giving (love)\".",

Right from the start, Rutherford states that the book won't be littered with references to research papers throughout and the book reads very much like Rutherford is quite literally telling me _a story_ (I should add that references are added in the appendix of the book if you want to validate and have further reading on the subject of DNA).<br /><br />I always feel like when I read non-fiction I'm supposed to be a little smarter once I've finished, and somehow retain my newly acquired knowledge so I can wax lyrical later on in the pub in years to come…<br /><br />The subject of this book is (as the title suggest) genes, DNA and how it all works. The book is fascinating, and although I'm certain that I'm zero percent smarter now (sadly my own failing!), Rutherford's book was littered with fascinating stories from both recent and distant history - which have so far stuck in my head.<br /><br />I got wind of this book via my own genealogy research, and being able to find every step in my ancestry to William The Conqueror, I posted a tweet and eventually saw a reply from Adam Rutherford explaining \"that's cool that you can demonstrate it with genealogy, but it’s literally true for all British people too. Edward 3 is the direct ancestor of every British person\". <br /><br />That snippet reply alone piqued my interest in reading this book, and damn glad I did - I think I highlighted nearly two pages worth of kindle notes, partly to help me remember and partly because there was some superb stuff in there, including:<br /><br />&gt; borborygmus, which is a technical word for a rumbly tummy.<br /><br />Rutherford's writing and storytelling is entertaining, informative and even regularly funny.",

It is unique to you, as it is to each of the 100 billion modern humans who have ever drawn breath. But it is also our collective story, because in every one of our genomes we each carry the history of our species births, deaths, disease, war, famine, migration, and a lot of sex.<br /><br /> Since scientists first read the human genome in 2001, it has been subject to all sorts of claims, counterclaims, and myths. In fact, as Adam Rutherford explains, our genomes should be read not as instruction manuals, but as epic poems. DNA determines far less than we have been led to believe about us as individuals, but vastly more about us as a species.<br /><br /> In this captivating journey through the expanding landscape of genetics, Adam Rutherford reveals what our genes now tell us about history, and what history tells us about our genes. From Neanderthals to murder, from redheads to race, dead kings to plague, evolution to epigenetics, this is a demystifying and illuminating new portrait of who we are and how we came to be.\""

I **loved** this series.<br /><br />The series follows Murderbot, a rouge security unit, mostly good at killing but who would rather just watch TV and be left alone. The first book reads easily as a stand alone, and I'd say the second book does too. <br /><br />The third and fourth pull together all the previous adventures into an overarching story that we see Murderbot learning about itself and struggling with the the concepts of emotions and desires.<br /><br />In fact, the Murderbot ends with that huge question of: what do you want.<br /><br />There's so many things I enjoyed about this series: it's a sci-fi that doesn't really require you to understand all the ins and outs of the political systems that exist in the world. I've read a few sci-fi books that really struggle to make the world believable because there's often so much to take in - the Murderbot diaries does this in a way that reads easily and lightly.<br /><br />The action sequences are really well written and fairly easy to follow - another thing I've struggled with in other books.<br /><br />Even though we know that the Murderbot is a construct, it exists in a time that emotions can be simulated - and therefore felt - by the Murderbot, which, just like any one of us, they don't relish having to process those emotions, and they'd much rather just shun away and hide away escaping with TV.<br /><br />Finally the characters are refreshing. As a white man myself, I'm too quick to assume the gender and race of the characters I reading about, Martha Wells does a really good job of keeping me in check, reminding me that Murderbot _doesn't_ have a gender, there's people in the universe that don't identify as one gender, and that not everyone is white.

This is the 2nd book in the murderbot books and the main character, who I realise now doesn't have a name (nor gender as it's a bot) is so fun to read. <br /><br />The murderbot is so dry and grumpy and so different from previous characters I've read in sci-fi.<br /><br />The first book definitely works as a stand alone, and although there's a self contained story in this second book, it definitely carries through a decent number of references to the earlier story that I'd not recommend reading this on it's own.<br /><br />Since the books are only around 160 pages, I'm moving right on to the next installment and looking forward to it already.",

    "review": "I wanted to love this book but I kinda fell short right at the end. However, the two protagonists: Patricia and Lawrence are beautifully written.<br /><br />The book is split over 3 era's of our characters' lives. Firstly when they're young children where the world is huge and wonderous. Patricia in particular has her first adventure very early in the book, and in part I wondered if this was entirely in a child's imagination rather than happening to her.<br /><br />The next era in the book Patricia and Lawrence are at (what I'd consider 'middle school'), and frankly it's horrible. They're bullied and targeted across the board. I found this part of the book the hardest hitting, and probably closer to the reality I know and it made me sad for the characters. I also felt like there was no real growth from this period of the book and they were simply tortured for being different and that wasn't addressed (or I missed it).<br /><br />Then the last era of the book the characters are young adults, Patricia a witch with more control over her powers (and yes, it seems that it wasn't her imagination back when she was a child), and Lawrence a full super nerd building a machine to save humanity. <br /><br />The story feels like it accelerates in momentum, complexity and consequence as it progresses. It reads really well, and the sci-fi aspects are fun, complex and draw some interesting moral questions.<br /><br />Except for me, the end just…kinda happened. I was following the story along, the world in the book was going to hell, level 10 dystopia stuff, and then all of a sudden the protagonists left alone, Patricia is following a pigeon to a tree, they have a weird conversation, she vaguely answers a question and then Patricia and Lawrence walk off together into the sunset (sort of) with a sense of hope and everything will be okay for them.<br /><br />Yet the world is still collapsing (mother nature trying to course correct), witches (and wizards?) are blasting people into unknown realms, and intend to unleash The Unravelling (which we meet once and it's a horror show), and the scientists are pissed and building mega machines to blow away the witches. So that's all still happening and yet Patricia and Lawrence seem to be okay.<br /><br />I was left feeling like I missed something crucial at the end of the book, because I felt like the characters were doom, but didn't realise it, and the world was going to die even though both Patricia and Lawrence intended to save it. So…yeah, I'm not sure.<br /><br />I loved the characters, and the writing was great and really original, and quite biting at times. But the more I thought about the end of the story, the more confused I felt.",

Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.<br />--scholastic.com"

I didn't realise this was the sixth novel of a series, but it really didn't matter - and almost added more depth since the characters had a lot more backstory.<br /><br />Robert Rankin's writing is really fun too. Lots of quick wit throughout the book, the kind that I wish I could come up with in my daily life!<br /><br />The story is a kind of comical farce whereby history has somehow shifted and things aren't quite what they're supposed to be.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure if the story is supposed to have a single protagonist or whether it's more of an ensemble. It certainly _mostly_ follows Jim, John and Soap (great…weird, name!). Then there's multiple side characters that I half suspect might have more story in other Brentwood books. <br /><br />All the same, it was really fun to read a book that clearly had a wide range of characters with more stories to tell.",

And this time they are up for a bit of good old Rock ‘n’ Roll.<br />It’s all down to John Omally really, he had always nurtured a secret ambition to become a rock star. He had mastered air guitar and bedroom mirror posing and all he really lacked for was talent. So, when a remarkable rock band named Ghandi’s Hairdryer comes to play in Brentford and John learns that they are looking for a manager, he can see a bright and profitable future laid out before him. He will become the new Brian Epstein.<br />Jim Pooley, John’s bestest friend, isn’t too keen. Because there is something rather odd about this band. Something other worldly. It might be the lead singer Litany, whose voice can heal the sick. She might be an angel. Or perhaps a devil. Because this is Brentford, after all. Jim would rather just concentrate on his own schemes for making it rich. His betting system, to pull off the six-horse-super-yankee accumulator bet. That future generations will know as The Pooley.<br />Norman the scientific cornershop keeper is hoping to help Jim out, by building him a race horse. It looks a simple enough matter, according to the back of the cigarette packet he’s worked out the entire genetic engineering project on. But there are always interruptions and things are turning decidedly strange in Norman’s kitchen lab.<br />Soap Distant has just returned from a journey to the centre of the Earth, and Soap isn’t happy. Things have changed since he’s been away. But things that happened before he went away. Someone is messing around with time. Why else would Richard Branson’s face be on the money?<br />Inspectre Hovis is at his wits’ end, very odd things are occurring in the borough of Brentford, folk appearing from nowhere, mysterious goings on and now the concert. The really big concert in Gunnersbury Park, the one where the Beatles will be playing, and Jim Morrison and Elvis too. That should be a concert worth watching, as long as nothing goes wrong.<br />And something might. Something really really big.<br />Because this is Brentford after all."

    "review": "Wow. I loved this book. I'm not entirely sure how I found it - I suspect Amazon randomly recommended it to me, and it was definitely a random purchase - but so glad I did.<br /><br />I'd just finished reading Snow Crash which has a small character which is an enhanced dog (called a Rat), and a few years back I'd read <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22358.We3\" rel=\"nofollow\">We3</a> which has animals who escape a tyranny of human kind…so I think I was expecting something like that. I was wrong!<br /><br />The book opens from the point of view of Rex, a \"bioform\" dog - part machine, part dog, part human DNA. The first few pages read as a little trite \"I am Rex. I am Good Dog\" etc - but this quickly falls away as I realised the darkness of what was being described from Rex's point of view. <br /><br />Then each chapter is told from different individuals point of view, including Hart - the engineer/carer for the bioforms, Honey - a bioform Bear and many other characters.<br /><br />The story is split over 5 parts that, I can assume, is covering several years. It starts in a war torn country, but once this part is over, the story goes on to raise the question of the bioform's rights, and whether a human-made thing can be human if it can feel for itself. By <em>human</em>, we mean the condition rather than the species.<br /><br />The story is a mix of the future of AI and augmented lifeforms, fear of different, corporations and their relationship with slavery - and through it, somehow, the protagonist is a dog that I can actually relate to as he even evolves through the book (the author does a brilliant job of evolving Rex's language and vocabulary as Rex is exposed to more of the world and the story moves on).<br /><br />Other thoughts that this book brought up for me:<br /><br />- If humankind make a <em>thing</em> and a thing can think for itself, should it have rights? What does that process look like - and how long does it take?<br />- Can and should humankind survive in it's current state. Is an augmented human less or more human? <br />- A fully autonomous intelligence is effectively immortal, so it can also outlive generations of humankind until the generations come to accept it?<br /><br />If you're interested in how technology can evolve in our future with AI, singularities, and the like, then I'd definitely recommend this book. <br /><br />I loved this story, really great stuff!",

      "description": "The story of <i>Hamlet</i> is not usually thought of as one meant for laughter. But Matt Haig's able retelling of the tale in <i>The Dead Fathers Club</i> will make you laugh, though it might also evoke a tear. Eleven-year-old Philip Noble is at his father's funeral when who should appear but his father's ghost, who wastes no time in telling Philip that his Uncle Alan, an auto mechanic, tampered with his car, causing the accident that killed him. He warns Philip that Uncle Alan will shortly be tampering with his mother too, because Unctuous Uncle Alan wants the pub that Philip's father owned. <p> The solution to this problem, according to Philip's dad, is that he must kill Uncle Alan. If he doesn't do it before Dad's next birthday, 11 weeks away, Dad will be consigned to the Terrors for all eternity. Philip agrees, in principle, but killing someone, especially without getting caught, isn't easy. But a promise is a promise, so Philip gives it a whirl, in fact, several whirls. Real life interferes in the persons of two school bullies, truly nasty and perverse thugs, who seem ready to kill Philip because they think it's funny that his father died. Philip also falls in love, and his Ophelia (named Leah) thinks that shoplifting is tons of fun. Poor Philip is in over his head in every way possible. There are many encounters with other Dead Fathers in a great sendup of ghostly dealings, <i>Hamlet</i>-like, on the moors, and several sly references to the play. There is even a character named Dane. The ending is not pure Shakespeare, but it is pure Haig and that is very good indeed. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>"

I loved the inner monologue that went with the Hell Hound!<br /><br />I don't think I've read a story with so many characters intertwining throughout a story (though, truth be told: I've not read many stories!) - and this book did a superb job of keeping all the characters unique, interesting and coherent.<br /><br />The story (for me), started fairly light (in heart) and towards the last quarter it goes rather dark - although this may be to be expected as the Armageddon is at hand. This also did wonders for my nightmares (I had three consecutive nights dreaming about my own End Of The World dreams).<br /><br />I'm also really impressed that two different authors created the story in a way that feels completely unified (and this edition included a Q&amp;A chapter at the end where Pratchett and Gaiman share their process and thoughts on each other).<br /><br />Really fun stuff and included some real laugh out loud moments. The entire last chapter could have been highlighted too - beautiful closing message.",

    "review": "My hospital read! I spent a day and night in hospital for tonsillitis, and managed to read through this book (though there's not a whole lot to do in hospital!).<br /><br />Originally this book was destined for a 3 star, but the last 5th of the book started to really pull the story together and made for quite a fun and gripping ending.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I selected this book to read because it was Ben Elton, and I'd read a few of his books before and was expecting satirical, witty and possibly funny. I did not expect this book! The characters are certainly witty, but there's no comedy to be found. This is a dark detective story.<br /><br />The story did feel a little crowded for the first half, it follows the protagonist Edward Newson, a detective inspector and a good one to boot. Newson is extremely well centred with respect to his work, and it makes him a good detective. <br /><br />In his personal life, he's off centre, but as the reader, I found his judgement quite questionable - and I'm not 100% sure if his character arc leaves him any better at the end.<br /><br />At the surface of the story, we have a murder mystery. A pretty graphically gruesome murder. Then there's some very strong elements of sex - and very graphic hardcore sex (which, I didn't really realise I was signing up to). Then there's a heavy bullying theme: how if affects an individual decades on, how the bullies continue to live, if they can move past it, whether it's rooted to their soul or not. Then there's unrequited love. Then there's nostalgia and reaching into the past and trying to rekindle feelings of hope and love and happiness.<br /><br />So…yeah, it felt a little crowded.<br /><br />Thankfully the last quarter somehow manages to pull a lot of the themes together (and drops a few on the way).<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed the story and enjoyed the gripping ending. It did all tie up a little too nicely, but then it's a story, so why shouldn't it?! :)",

The story is told directly from the point of view of the murderbot which makes for a utterly new take on the alien-type stories where shit (always) goes bad.<br /><br />The murderbot itself is an really refreshing take on the future of bots, who through first \"person\" storytelling, mostly wants to be by itself, avoids talking about it's feelings, dislikes any eye contact and general doesn't really give two hoots about anything except for their TV binge watching.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this short story, reading it in (about) one sitting on holiday. Now the only downside is that it _is_ a short, I finished it so quickly and I don't get to enjoy more of the murderbot protagonist.

Loved it.<br /><i></i><br />If I'm honest the title is what attracted me to the book and I had hoped it would be a brilliant read - and it absolutely was!<br /><br />The story kicks off immediately into the first few pages where people have start to lose their shadows, and the knock on effect is that they forget, they forget all sorts of things, then they forget their name, or forget their parent's names, or that they had a husband or wife or children, then forget how to speak. Then more mind bendingly, they forget that a thing is a thing, an in doing so reality changes around them - such as forgetting that a place exists then all of a sudden that place really doesn't exist taking all it's inhabitants with it.<br /><br />The story follows a few key characters dedicating chapters to telling each of their story and the effect this epidemic (of sorts) affects their lives. So the story is very much about humans even though it lives inside an almost magical epidemic. <br /><br />I like that the story doesn't particularly try to explain how the shadows are lost or why and why it affects some people faster than others.<br /><br />A wonderfully written book that swept me along.

Orwell's writing has lasted near perfectly (i.e. modern and in context) some 70 years later (which frankly blows my mind).<br /><br />The story breaks into three parts as we make our way into Winston's mind. Part 1 reads like I'm learning around his world and how he experiences it. The mundane work, the acceptance of his role, whilst he secretly scratches his mind back.<br /><br />In part 2, I feel like I'm taking into Winston's heart as he re-experiences the world and the life and love that still exists in it. I loved some of the expressions and sadness that came with those expressions. Such as Winston knowing that what he was doing was against the \"rules\", and that it was simply an inevitability of being caught and tortured. <br /><br />He believes that he's given up his body already to the world of 1984, and when the Thought Police catch him, they'll take his mind, and so long as he protects his heart, he'll live on.<br /><br />Part 3 is mostly from inside of Winston's mind, as O'Brian works firstly to break Winston's mind, but then puts it back together in The Party's form. The place that O'Brian (and thusly The Party) comes from is entirely bleak and worse, believable in my own reality today. <br /><br />O'Brian utters phrases like:<br /><br />&gt; Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older? Nothing exists except through human consciousness.<br /><br />Bleak. <br /><br />Eventually, there's no winning. There's no happy ending. There never could be. Winston's heart is pierced, he's _made_ to love Big Brother, and only then, when he's fully remade in The Party's eyes, does it end.

The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written."

I'm always amazed at how current a book written in 1931 can be so current and readable nearly a century later in 2018.<br /><br />The Brave New World is set in a future some centuries away where happiness is society's key. Religion, art, science and truth have been sacrificed to archive global sustainable happiness. <br /><br />People are engineered from embryo though constant tweaking at the fertilisation process and growth, then though as children conditioned using Pavlovian techniques: you read a book, you get zapped - aged 18 months. Aged 6 the children engage in \"erotic play\". Sleep hypnosis with rhymes that the individuals will live inside society with. Each individual is predestined for a class in society: alphas, betas, down to the \"epsilon semi-morons\" - button pushers. <br /><br />All seemingly pretty grotesque, but much later in the book, the benefits of this new world are argued, and it's a fairly convincing argument. Everything is for the sake of happiness. <br /><br />Ignorance is bliss. The less truth there is to be sought, the more content you are with your reality. And thus, a stable, sustainable, healthy society.<br /><br />---<br /><br />It seems as through there's three protagonist with increasing complexity to break the orthodox rules of the New World.<br /><br />Lenina allows herself to romanticise being with one person, and feeling love, but this is surface-deep and she's still very much a slave to her conditioning and unable to see beyond these walls.<br /><br />Bernard Marx, an Alpha plus who appears visibly as a Delta, with nasty rumours that alcohol had been slipped into his fertilisation process. He is able to think and speak outside of his orthodox conditioning but when it comes to acting, he falls short, and in fact proves himself more of a coward (or in fact probably as most would act: though inaction).<br /><br />John (the) Savage is different. He has a mother. He's learnt of God, learned to read and reads Shakespeare. He was born an outcast in The Old World (The Savage Reserve), and brought into the New World when Bernard and Lenina stumble upon him and his mother (originally from the new world but became injured and lost in the reservation some 20 years prior).<br /><br />John is the only one who questions and tries to change the new world that he now lives, and, obviously fails. The new world is centuries in the making. <br /><br />John is relatable because he comes from *our* time. And this is why he's a man out of time. <br /><br />There's nothing he can do to change society in an impactful way, and even if he did, it would be at the sacrifice of happiness of others. <br /><br />It's almost an inevitability that he goes mad. That he doesn't survive this brave new world. He can't. He can't escape it, and so, in the end, like any good Shakespeare tragedy, he tries and fails to extract himself from society, as it's impossible, in a rage of madness, goes on to kill the woman he loves, and then himself. <br /><br />An amazing, and maddening tale.

Largely set in a futuristic World State, inhabited by genetically modified citizens and an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by only a single individual: the story's protagonist."

    "review": "The two stars are for: fairly decent writing, it wasn't a rabib page turner, but it was relatively easy going for the most part.<br /><br />The second star is for such an interesting idea: a cure for death - or more specifically, a genetic cure for the aging of cells.<br /><br />The story leaps right into this concept and the mental struggle the protagonist, John, faces with the prospect of living forever (or until something else kills him). <br /><br />The possibilities of this concept are endless…but it felt like this book struggled to grapple with these ideas and, for me, just failed to follow through.<br /><br />For instance, there's a key character (you'd be lead to think) that appears right at the start, that captures John's intrigue (and frankly I thought they were related to \"thriller\", but apparently not). This character then isn't mentioned at all for the majority of the book, and then around 85% of the way through when they suddenly reappear and John _suddenly_ declares his undying love.<br /><br />&gt; She sighed. “I told you. I’m tired of men falling in love with me.” “I don’t give a shit.” I moved to her and began kissing her.<br /><br />Oh for heaven's sake. She just suddenly does a 180 on her own feelings and goes for a full shag before leaping off to a nuclear winter.<br /><br />The story spends a solid half of the book on John and his family and surrounding and the (local) effect of the cure. No thriller in sight, and certainly no End Specialists. I can't tell if this was more of a drama or just a _lot_ of character building, but it really didn't feel like I got into the meat of the book until much, much further along.<br /><br />This book comes with an alternative title of \"Postmortals\" (I read The End Specialist), which would frankly makes a lot more sense. As for being a thriller - I don't think so. <br /><br />Also with this kind of massive change in humanity, the worldwide ramifications would be huge, and though John does try to portray these in his documentary-like updates (a blog?), it really feels quite local to Amuricka.<br /><br />Sadly the book deals with an excellent concept, but fails to deliver.",

The version I've read is apparently a faithful and good translation but I do always wonder if the language has been modified or not (in one section I found a reference to electric toothbrushes - something that was invented some 30 years later).<br /><br />None the less, the words to this book really are poetry.<br /><br />The problem I had is that I really wasn't sure where I was in the story. The character thinks he's going insane, but he's actually discovering he has a soul, but often it did read like a madman and hallucinations.<br /><br />It does end predictably, but only because I've already read the likes of 1984. I can't imagine the impact on a reader reading this back in the late 1920s. It's also worth adding that the writing really does hold up nearly a century later, which is baffling amazing. <br /><br />So, great stuff for nearly 100 years old, but \"just okay\" because I struggled to fully follow the character.",

More of a fiction montage than a novel in the conventional sense, this stunning literary debut chronicles Suzanne's vivid, excruciatingly funny experiences-from the clinic to her coming to terms with life in the outside world. Conversations with her psychiatrist-\"What worries me is, what if this guy is really the one for me and I haven't had enough therapy to be comfortable with having found him?\"; a high-concept, eighties-style affair-\"The only way to become intimate for me is repeated exposure. My route to intimacy is routine. I establish a pattern with somebody and then I notice when they're not there?\" Sparked by Suzanne's-and Carrie Fisher's-deliciously wry sense of the absurd, Postcards from the Edge is more than a book about stardom and drugs.

The book is as much a psychological exploration of his childhood as it is a sci-fi - and for that it makes for a really heartfelt story.<br /><br />There is one, large, aspect that doesn't track. Bare with me because I know Keyes wrote the book was written in 1966 (based off his short story written in 1958), but Charlie's emotional feelings towards Alice (and women in general) doesn't quite make sense.<br /><br />Charlie had **severe** learning disabilities. He struggled to understand a lot of context in the world around him and we know that he has an emotional of a child. <br /><br />If a child, a boy in particular, were to, suddenly, today have their IQ accelerated, their behaviour towards women and girls wouldn't suddenly be that of an adult man. Specifically they wouldn't behave like the men that _expect_ women to pay them attention, or expect women to be sexually available just because they engaged in conversation. This behaviour isn't part of men's DNA.<br /><br />Yet Charlie's character behaves this way when his IQ jumps. And yes, I'm overthinking it, but the fun thing about reading a great sci-fi is that it lets me ask more interesting questions about my world. And yes, this is rather _woke_ thing to bring up about a book!<br /><br />On the flip side, something I loved about the book is when Charlie does go back into his memories, it made me ask the question: do we have the ability for 100% recall? <br /><br />Is it possible that we all have photographic memories but the majority of us can't access that part of our mind. If we do have the ability, doesn't that suggest that memory recall, for the most minute detail, is entirely possible - even to recall the details in something that was in our peripheral vision some decades ago?<br /><br />If we do indeed have this ability, assuming Charlie's operation can unlock this part of our mind, does this mean we can potentially time travel inside our mind as those recalled memories become so visceral that they become reality during that recall.<br /><br />Very cool stuff.<br /><br />Then within the sci-fi and the character study of Charlie's psyche, we have the heartbreaking story of his childhood and whether it's possible for forgiveness all those decades later. Beautiful stuff.",

In <i>Wishful Drinking</i>, adapted from her one-woman stage show, Fisher reveals what it was really like to grow up a product of \"Hollywood in-breeding,\" come of age on the set of a little movie called <i>Star Wars</i>, and become a cultural icon and bestselling action figure at the age of nineteen. <p> Intimate, hilarious, and sobering, <i>Wishful Drinking</i> is Fisher, looking at her life as she best remembers it (what do you expect after electroshock therapy?). It's an incredible tale: the child of Hollywood royalty—Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher—homewrecked by Elizabeth Taylor, marrying (then divorcing, then dating) Paul Simon, having her likeness merchandized on everything from Princess Leia shampoo to PEZ dispensers, learning the father of her daughter forgot to tell her he was gay, and ultimately waking up one morning and finding a friend dead beside her in bed. </p><p> <i>Wishful Drinking</i>, the show, has been a runaway success. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> declared it \"drolly hysterical\" and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> called it a \"Beverly Hills yard sale of juicy anecdotes.\" This is Carrie Fisher at her best—revealing her worst. She tells her true and outrageous story of her bizarre reality with her inimitable wit, unabashed self-deprecation, and buoyant, infectious humor.</p>"

    "review": "Wow this book was a slow read given that it was only 198 pages. It took me 4 weeks, which, isn't a huge amount of time, but the first 80% of the book felt like an age that just wouldn't end.<br /><br />I was originally going to rate this book 1 star but it changed toward the end (the last 20% as I'll explain).<br /><br />Holden Caulfield, as read by myself a near 40 year old man, is a bit of a whingebag, if put subtly. He's self centred and believes the world owes him something - god knows what though. The 1950s language doesn't really pose much of a problem (as I read it), and I appreciate that lives were very different to that of 70 years later in ~2018. Not being a teenager myself, I'm not pissed off at everyone for existing so I had trouble connecting to a large part of the story that Holden shares with me during the book.<br /><br />The book is also fairly heavy with 1950s sexism, and it isn't uncommon to come across lines like \"the trouble with girls is…\". It's hard to read and I can imagine how it perpetuates the image of men being above women for the following decades. Either it's reflecting how men thought at the time, or it re-enforces how they were <i>supposed</i> to think.<br /><br />Also, the trouble with Holden was that his (teenage) exaggeration made it hard to tell what was real and what was imagined and what was him simply trying to be older to his peers. Sometimes I was just confused as to what was real and what wasn't. But then he'd share his feelings about his family, sister and deceased brother Allie…<br /><br />When Holden <i>did</i> talk about his family, it seems like you're able to see the real Holden under all the complexities of being a teenager. Then finally, around the 85% mark, Holden shares with his younger (adored) sister, that if he could be anything he would be:<br /><br /><blockquote>\"I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around-nobody big, I mean-except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start going over the cliff–I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.\"</blockquote><br /><br />I think, this is to say, he feels this unbearable responsibility to save his lost brother, and protect his family (and those around him) from the inevitable end.<br /><br />Although Holden meets and (rightly) flees from a questionable encounter with an old teacher, moments before that teacher shares what I think what has been eating away at Holden all this time…and possibly for future years to come:<br /><br /><blockquote>\"The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that wants to live humbly for one.\"</blockquote><br /><br />Something I realise that Holden struggles with, even at the early age of 16/17, and that he and many others, struggle with for year to come.<br /><br />---<br /><br />So, after what was a fairly painful experience over 4 weeks of listening to Holden's complaining and poor view of life, I've come to soften my view of the poor soul and realise that he's just tortured and struggling and that it just took a whole lot of pages to get to what's really important to him.",

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. <br /><br />J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on <i>Time</i>'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read."

The War with the Newts, Capek create an all encompassing story that not only covers the entire planet earth, but also allows for economical, sociological, financial and political effects of the tale being told.<br /><br />The book can sometimes come across as a quite dry historical account of how the world, and indeed, mankind came to exist with the Newts. But then throughout the book we follow a very small number of characters and eventually returning to the butler who burdened himself with the guilt of introducing the newts to the world, which leads to the inevitable near-end of mankind.<br /><br />I found the story telling quite brilliant in the ability to describe, in such believable detail, the impact of these newts being on earth, the changes to their environment that allowed for their growth and the world wide impact of this ecological change.<br /><br />But it was the last two chapters that really won the story for me.

His son isn't so sure, and in a turn towards the end of the chapter, we see that the butler has been carrying the torment of \"what if…\", what if *he* had made a different decision: would the world's fate be in safe hands now?<br /><br />Then the final chapter was (again, sorry) quite brilliant. A discussion between the author and himself as the writer, trying to determine if mankind's fate is truly doomed. Whether humankind has any way to save itself from its own inevitable self destruction through greed and fear. Or whether the newts are inevitably prone to the same failings as humankind too…<br /><br />A tough, and sometime dry read, but really quite excellent!",

      "description": "One of the great anti-utopian satires of the twentieth century, an inspiration to writers from Orwell to Vonnegut, at last in a modern translation. Man discovers a species of giant, intelligent newts and learns to exploit them so successfully that the newts gain skills and arms enough to challenge man's place at the top of the animal kingdom. Along the way, Karel Capek satirizes science, runaway capitalism, fascism, journalism, militarism, even Hollywood."

    "review": "(warning: not really a review, more of a thing to remind me of the book)<br /><br />Overall, a fairly cinematic story akin to the genre I'd expect The Matrix to fall into. If I'm completely honest, I did occasionally lose track of what was going on through the story (it took me a good few weeks to read it), but the story and two main characters managed to carry me along.<br /><br />I also have to admit that it took me a little while to get past the corny named main character \"Hiro Protagonist\" and the overly macho techno all black, motorcycles and swords. Of course, Hiro is the world's best swordsman…obviously. Though when I just went with it, it was pretty good fun.<br /><br />Neal Stephenson writing was extremely good at visualising a scene and the objects in the world the characters live in (in reading the acknowledgement I learnt that the book was intended as a graphic novel and I wonder if there was graphic work he was describing). All the same, it was very easy to read and see the world as we moved from reality, to the metaverse (virtual world), to vehicles and different landscapes.<br /><br />There's a tonne of historical and religious background to the story too, most of which I understand to be based on real research (from our universe) and the depth of which was incredible.<br /><br />The Snow Crash is (supposed to be) a virus that exists in both the digital world and the real world. The story creates (perhaps tenuous?) links between computer/digital ideas and pre-biblical times explaining that the story of Babel was the first instance of the virus, transmitted through verbal programming, affecting humankind. <br /><br />The two other main-ish characters were Y.T (a young women/teenager who we follow in parallel with Hiro) and Raven. Y.T. is really fun, and perhaps more relatable since she's a little more \"regular\" (compared with Hiro) - just kitted out with lots of tricks in her suit.<br /><br />Raven is the uber baddie, throwing glass spears, cutting through bulletproof suits and generally being invisible. He definitely plays the \"main henchman\" really well, and we even get to understand his motives which I love for a \"proper\" baddie.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book, left a little confused about the motivation about some of the connections in the book (like what really motivates Y.T. to join forces with Hiro, or how Hiro was one of the first creators of the metaverse, yet he's somehow a promotor for his roommate's band…). <br /><br />Sorry, not much of a review, more a prompt for my own memory in years to come!",

    "review": "I did enjoy this story (the 3 stars wasn't a 5 for any negative reasons) - it's pretty well paced, and discusses some particularly interesting ideas – and at the time I read this book whilst I was also reading <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30135182.A_Brief_History_of_Everyone_Who_Ever_Lived_The_Stories_in_Our_Genes\" title=\"A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived The Stories in Our Genes by Adam Rutherford\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes</a> which is pertinent to the subject matter The Chrysalids covers: genetics.<br /><br />This particular edition was also prefaced with an introduction essay, which I feel like I'm cheating when I read, because it explains core concepts much more explicitly and throughout the story, these ideas are provided additional context for me.<br /><br />The story follows David and his struggle to fit in in the world (or certainly <i>his</i> world). The planet has been ravished by something that has scrambled DNA across all life, and humanity (as we meet it in the start of the book) is holding dearly onto \"pure\" existence. \"Pure\" being applied to crops, animals and humans, or \"man\". <br /><br />The result of a non-pure human (an extra toe or misshapen bones or perhaps an extra chromosome?) leads to that individual being sent to the \"Fringes\", perhaps even exiled to the Badlands, or just murdered. For intolerance.<br /><br />Except David does not fit in, and the community is ultimately fearful of change and they religiously to stem it's progress. The thing is: life is change.<br /><br />---<br /><br />One of the more poignant moments (to me) was between David and his uncle (who is sympathetic to \"Deviations\"), where his uncle questions the ideas and definitions of \"pure\" and \"pure man\", and how it is horribly flawed. <br /><br />This entire exchange prompted me to consider what we, in <i>our</i> society and <i>our</i> communities accept as written in stone. And perhaps I'd do well to remember that just because something \"is\" doesn't mean it should be.<br /><br />---<br /><br />A character that I struggled a little with, was Sophie. Her character early in the story was strong and inquisitive about the world. When we meet her much later in the story and in life, she knows what she wants, but her wants are limited to the world she now exists in. Specifically she works to protect her position as the raped partner of the head of her tribe. <br /><br />Sophie's character is possibly the most heartbreaking, and I wish she had been able to escape her destiny.<br /><br />Yet, when David, his cousin Rosalind and his sister Petra escape to a new land at the end of the story, the intolerance exists in this new community, though it seems the only difference is that they know that they will be succeeded eventually (and not without putting up a fight).",
