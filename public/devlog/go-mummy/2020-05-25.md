During development I've been using [Cspect](http://cspect.org/) and for certain bits like yesterday's Fisher-Yates shuffle, I'll use `% RND` to get random numbers.

However, I also want to prevent my game from being repeatable so I use `RANDOMIZE` as a standalone call which is supposed randomly seed the random functions:

> RANDOMIZE on its own (and RANDOMIZE 0 has the same effect) is different, because it really does randomise RND and % RND

And with any basic understanding of random numbers, they have to be seeded from something in the real world, so _time_ is used:

> RANDOMIZE uses the time since the computer was switched on. Since this has gone up by the same amount each time RANDOMIZE is executed, the next % RND does more or less the same. You would get better randomness by replacing GO TO 10 by GO TO 20.

â€¦and of course, when Cspect launches into my code to immediately run it, the time is *exactly the same* on each start up, so the seed, is also exactly the same! ðŸ¤¦

I've been avoiding the details of gameplay until I got some of the core basics working - specifically the status of the tombs and when they were open or not.

But now I've got that working, I decided to revisit the game and [play it](https://archive.org/details/Oh_Mummy_1984_Amsoft) looking at how the mummy's behaviour works. 

A few observations that I'll need to add:

1. Mummy's can't walk past each other (currently mine can slide under each other)
2. The level difficulty applies to the AI in the mummy - current mine are turning entirely random. I suspect if I want to add AI, I'll need to decrease the random effect as difficulty increases
3. Mummy's revealed in a tomb follow you to the next level, and if you don't lose a life from a mummy (or kill a mummy using a scroll), the in game mummy number increases quickly, so the game needs to work with 5+ mummy's in play (currently adding mummy's has a direct impact on game speed)

I've also been reviewing how I'll unveil the tombs. Currently I'm throwing on a `LAYER ERASE` (which has glitches in Cspect) but this won't fly when I want to draw on the scroll etc. So it's likely I'll create a tile map for these areas at some point soon.
