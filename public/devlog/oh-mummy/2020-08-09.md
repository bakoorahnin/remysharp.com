The last series of work has been play testing, trying to catalogue and fix bugs and adding polish the game where possible.

I've been wanting to bring a bit more visual interest to the screens I had though I'm limited in the game itself, the main options screen could do with some love.

The screen initially I'd picked [Papyrus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhlJNJopOQ), albeit at random for it's oldworldly feel and the screen looked like this:

But I wanted something that harked back a little to the original game roots and give it a bit of an egyptian feel (or certainly what I imagine that would feel like).

I ran through a number iterations until I found a font and some border images that started to bring it together:

The first was a little too _streetwise_ and the second looked like it would suit a shooting game of some sort. I liked the third, but the fourth felt a little more dynamic which is how I think of the game - a bit frantic.

To get this to load into NextBASIC, I have three options:

1. I can export as an 8-bit BMP and load on the machine using `.bmpload` - which is probably fine, but has a little more latency that I'd like.
2. I can convert the file first to an BMP and then to [an SL2 file](https://wiki.specnext.dev/File_Formats) - which is a pure dump of the screen layer. Then easily loaded back in using `LAYER 2,1: LOAD "screen.sl2" LAYER`. This is quick (there's no calculation to be done as it represents a memory dump) but it does read of the SD card. This would be fine if I was showing this screen once, but I show it many times, particularly through the option screens.
3. Generate the SL2 file, and load individual thirds into banks - this is the method I used since the data is loaded in memory for quick copying back into the screen memory.

I made [another online tool](https://zx.remysharp.com/tools/) that lets me upload any file format, and so long as it's 256x192 (or not wider than 256) then my code will translate the data to both an 8-bit BMP (with the default Spectrum Next palette) _and_ an SL2 file (which is very similar to a BMP, just ordered slightly differently).

Once I have the SL2 file, I need to break it into 3 equal parts of 16K (the size of a memory bank) and for the final touch, the last third of the screen is solid black for 16 lines - which I can do at the same time.

A unix tool called `dd` can be used to split the file up:

```sh
$ dd if=screen.sl2 of=screen1.bin bs=16k count=1 skip=0
$ dd if=screen.sl2 of=screen2.bin bs=16k count=1 skip=1
$ dd if=screen.sl2 of=screen3.bin bs=16k count=1 skip=2
```

This will create 3 files of 16K blocks each (based on screen.sl2).

The final task is to block out the last 16 lines in black pixels - `0x00` which conveniently is what comes out of `/dev/zero`, so I can source that stream and use `dd` to write it into the `screen3.bin` file:

```sh
$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=4k count=1 oseek=3 of=screen3.bin
```

Now the binary files can be reploaded into banks then loaded into the LAYER on demand:

```nextbasic
LOAD "screen1.bin" BANK 20
LOAD "screen2.bin" BANK 21
LOAD "screen3.bin" BANK 22
; later in the code
BANK 20 COPY TO 9   ; bank 9 is the start of LAYER 2
BANK 21 COPY TO 10
BANK 22 COPY TO 11
```

So the state of play on Sunday 9 August is that all the (known) bugs are fixed, the new music and sound effects are in place, high scores are updating and saving. I'm investigating a couple of performance tweaks (that aren't required, but will be nice if I can it off) which leaves me with one last problem to solve.

Do I keep the name _"Oh Mummy!"_? There's other clones of Amsoft's Oh Mummy, some have a different name, some reuse the name, but there is a question over copyright. I'd hope that copyright holders would see this as a hat-tip to old but it bears considering.

So, so far there's some ideas:

- Mummy Mummy!
- Return of Oh Mummy!
- Oh Daddy!
- Go Mummy!
- (and) Oh Remmmy!

Although the last one is rather self serving, I quite like it - just trying to work out how it fits in the story line… (I also prefer titles that are approximately the same length as the original).

So close…
