During game play it always bothered me that there was no fluidity to the interaction. That is, you select a block and they swap into the right place.

There's no falling effect, no selection effect, just - vanish.

NextBASIC doesn't have much bandwidth (compared to assembly) but it does leverage hardware sprites via a handful of NextBASIC (software) routines (AKA the _Sprite System_), which translates to: do a bit more for a bit less.

So I've added this animation when you select a block in the game. It's a bit of a fiddle, mostly because I'm working within the constraints of NextBASIC but I think it does the trick:

![Marbles block select animation](/images/devlog/marbles-anim.gif)

The animation above plays the selection in slow motion (around 10% speed), then repeats the animation (for demonstration purposes) faster and faster until it's 100% speed.

What's nice is that the animation works for all the different block themes I've designed. It's an animating layer over the top of each of the blocks settling on a solid black, as seen below in the four frames (note that the white is actually transparent):

![Frames of marble animation](/images/devlog/anim-frames.png)

So what are you actually seeing with respect to layers and sprites?

All of the blocks for the game are sprites (rather than tiles which might be a more traditional approach). This is a bit of a cheap move on my part, but it let's me do "low cost" collision testing. I can also address each block from an index which happens to be the block index in memory.

When you select a block (a collision is detected between the pointer sprite and the block), _underneath_ the block sprite a 16x16 tile is painted (so if I removed the sprite, it would look like the block was still there).

Then the sprite block's pattern (the image in the sprite) is changed to transparent. So you're seeing _through_ the sprite to the tile underneath.

Now a sprite pattern sequence is run using `SPRITE CONTINUE` running through the frames you saw earlier. The effect is that the black border closes in on the block making it _look_ like it's shrinking. Once the sequence has come to it's end (something I have to check in the code), the tiles are removed by painting the entire layer with black - and the "layer" is under the sprites so this doesn't change any appearance.

Each block that matches the block type/pattern has the following code applied:

```nextbasic
SPRITE CONTINUE %k, STOP , STOP ,51 TO 54, BIN 01100000,10,0
```

Pages 9 and 10 of the [NextBASIC new commands and features](https://gitlab.com/thesmog358/tbblue/-/blob/master/docs/nextzxos/NextBASIC_New_Commands_and_Features.pdf) shows how `BIN 0110000` works:

- Bit 6: update pattern even when sprite is stationary
- Bit 5: sprite is disabled when pattern reaches limits

Though I didn't find bit 5 actually useful, because I needed a way to _know_ when the animation had completed, so I could then make the blocks fall.

To solve that, I run a loop - which is required to get the animation to update anyway - and I check the pattern state of just one of the sprites:

```nextbasic
REPEAT
  SPRITE MOVE
  ; %k is the last sprite id, 2 means "test pattern value"
  %i=% SPRITE AT (k,2)
REPEAT UNTIL %i=54 :; 54 is the final pattern in the animation
```

With those small bits working together, I get a little animation. It's not _quite_ perfect, because during that `REPEAT` the whole interface is locked - specifically the player's cursor can't move, and adding a call to update it's position significantly slows the animation, so there's no point.
