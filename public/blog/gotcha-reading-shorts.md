# Gotcha: Reading shorts

Just in case you came here to find out what kind of shorts you need to wear for the best reading experience, I'll tell you up front: you'll be disappointed. A [short is a 16 bit integer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)#Common_integral_data_types). Though I think this is just as interesting!

Recently I had a requirement to read a file that contained an array of 16bit values. This means _pairs of bytes_. When we read files in the browser or in Node we get byte (8bit) and the process _should_ be straight forward to view this data as 16bit data, but, as you might guess, it's not.

## On the web

The web makes it mostly straight forward so long as you're working with files arranged in the same endianness as your own system.

I want to write about endianness (mostly for my own understanding and recollection), but in lieu of that, MDN have a [good article on endianness](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Endianness) (TL;DR: defines the byte order, little being the bytes are reversed, which is also the most common format).

To get a 16bit array out of a file, the process is relatively straight forward:

```js
// assuming result is an arrayBuffer, possibly from readAsArrayBuffer
// [1, 2, ...]
result.byteLength // ? 512
const data = new Uint16Array(result);
data.length // ? 256 elements - correct (2 bytes per value)
data[0] // ? first value is 513 (0x0201)
```

However, if your machine is little endian and your file is big endian (not super likely, but still), there's no straight forward way of getting this data so it needs a helping hand:

```js
// result is an arrayBuffer - as above
const view = new DataView(result);
const data = new Uint16Array(result.byteLength/2);
for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
  data[i] = view.getUint16(i * 2, false); // false = read as big endian
}
data[0] // ? first value is now 258 (0x0102)
```

Though, I still find it odd that the system defaults to little endian and yet `getUint16` defaults to big endian (if the `false` boolean is omitted).

Node is a bit more of a struggle.

## Inside node

When reading a file in Node using the `fs` module, either `readFile` or `readFileSync` you'll get a Node specific `Buffer` back. It extends the `ArrayBuffer` so you can get to the underlying buffer but you can't throw it into a new 16bit array - you need to use some careful code.

I don't fully understand the inner workings, but when you do a `readFile` there's a `poolSize` property that changes has the data sits in the buffer. From the [docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_byteoffset):

> ‚Ä¶when allocating a buffer smaller than Buffer.poolSize, the buffer doesn't start from a zero offset on the underlying ArrayBuffer.

To see this in action, I can read a file and throw the buffer into a `Uint16Array` and see how wrong it is:

```js
// result is a Buffer object, which contains the same data arrangement
// as our earlier example: [1, 2, ...] an a length of 512 bytes
const bad = new Uint16Array(file.buffer);
bad.length // ? 4096 - üò±wat
bad[0] // ? 8827 (and changes each time I run the code)
```

Clearly not good. This is because there's junk bytes on our buffer, and so we need to makes sure we pick out the data correctly:

```js
const good = new Uint16Array(file.buffer, file.byteOffset, file.length / 2);
good.length // ? 256 üëç
good[0] // ? 513 üëç
```

Node has a [convenience method for swapping](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_swap16) the endianness of the bytes: `swap16`. Calling this method before loading the buffer into the `Uint16Array` will change the data from little endian (in my current case) to big endian.

So that's how to get 16bit data.
