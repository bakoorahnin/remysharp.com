# Books I read in 2020

This year has been a bit of an odd reading year. On one hand I've read some books I've absolutely entirely fallen in love with whilst at the same time I've read a few books (and am _still_ reading now) that are of average length but have taken me what felt like an age to read (_Children of Time_). I also read 10% of a book (_The Stone Man_) this year and hated so much that I stop there but still had to leave myself a review. I did manage 7,559 pages of 23 books (I'm excluding the 10% book…  ).

My absolute favourite this year (and goes straight into my most favourite books of all time) was [The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet](/books/2020/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet) by Becky Chambers - _this is the first book, that I can remember, that has made me laugh (multiple times) out loud(!) and cry_.

Instead of my usual listing of all the reviews, since I now [publish](/feeds) [all my reviews](/books) directly on this web site, instead I've included some statistical breakdown of the books I've read.

**Longest book**: [Children of Time (Children of Time #1)](/books/2020/children-of-time-children-of-time-1) - 609 pages

**Shortest book**: [All My Friends Are Superheroes](/books/2020/all-my-friends-are-superheroes) _by Andrew Kaufman_ - 54 pages

**Quickest read**: 4 days

- [In the Dark (DI Adam Fawley, #2)](/books/2020/in-the-dark-di-adam-fawley-2) _by Cara Hunter_ (444 pages)
- [Flowers for Algernon](/books/2020/flowers-for-algernon) _by Daniel Keyes_ - (228 pages)

**Longest read/slog**: 54 days

- [Children of Time (Children of Time #1)](/books/2020/children-of-time-children-of-time-1) _by Adrian Tchaikovsky_ (609 pages)

**Diversity of authors**:

- Women: 8 - 6 of the books I read in 2020 we written by the same two authors (still counted as unique authors)
- Men: 11

Those who were not white authors, I believe there was only one to my discredit. Frustratingly some of my favourite authors are women and non-white women, so I really must do better to find more books from this background.

On that note, the majority of the books I read this year were from the 2010s era, though I also know this is related to two of my favourite authors this year publishing their books during this period: Becky Chambers and Cara Hunter. Though I do enjoy the classics (understandably as they've lasted the test of time).
