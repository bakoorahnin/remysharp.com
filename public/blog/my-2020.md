# My 2020

As with [previous years](https://remysharp.com/search?q=title%3Amy%2020) I like to leave myself and end of year note to remind Future Remy what he was up to. So hereon in is my last me-me-me post of 2020.

## The 2020 backdrop

I very much doubt if Future Remy has forgotten this year, but on the off chance, it was the one with the pandemic. Hopefully the only one in my lifetime, but wow. Oh, and Brexit of the no deal flavour. And Trump, and Johnson - two disgusting individuals representing parties and views that are so utterly distant to my own moral values that I feel like the world is splitting in half.

Vaccines for COVID-19 have started to be deployed but as yet we don't know what that looks like, and I suspect 2021 for the most part will be locked down similarly to 2020. I do hope the death toll is lower, much lower and thank the stars none of my immediate family or friends have been lost in 2020.

For some of the bizarre context, for me, I hadn't put my shoes on in around 4 months (because I didn't leave the house), I've completely fallen out of the habit of the gym (because it was closed) and seeing friends in real life is like mainlining happiness directly into my eyeballs (as it had been so rare).

Anyway, it's super likely I didn't forget. Now onward with the things I did manage to do.

## Professional

- There was **no ffconf 12**. ffconf makes up a decent chunk of our business income, so that was weird. Though we were far from alone. We had it all booked for Friday 13th too (my birthday is 13th and I was 13 on Friday 13th, so this combo is particularly special to me). We missed our ffconf friends.
- **Speaking** - once (and no virtual talks for me - so far). I did have the pleasure of reprising the _How We Built the World Wide Web in Five Days_ with [Jeremy](https://adactio.com/) right before the full lockdown happened.
- **Client work** - oddly I've been busy (oddly because I know businesses have collapsed in 2020). I've had steady long term contracts (which on reflection was massively important this year). Conversely though I've had 2 weeks of in the entire year, so I was starting to go a bit stir crazy.

## Blogging

Somehow my blogging has increased over the months. A number of years ago I set myself a default 2 per month cadance, but this year I've been averaging 4-5 posts a month. Hopefully a trend. My most popular posts from 2019:

## Personal

- **Medical**: MS
- Whittling
- Spectrum
- 6502
- **Reading**: The 2019 me continues to read and I took on some pretty serious sci-fi including the Chinese series The Three Body Problem (serious for me). I'm really enjoying reading and for the first time I find myself buying books from authors that I'm already familiar with. A big deal for a historical non-reader.

## Onward: 2021
