# How do you set the value in an order list?

Not with CSS, that's how!

```html
<ol>
  <li value="3">This is item three.</li>
  <li value="50">This is item fifty.</li>
  <li value="100">This is item one hundred.</li>
</ol>
```

Result:

<ol>
  <li value="3">This is item three.</li>
  <li value="50">This is item fifty.</li>
  <li value="100">This is item one hundred.</li>
</ol>

I only I had read the [HTML5 Doctor articles](http://html5doctor.com/ol-element-attributes/#start-value-attribute) we were putting out at the time ðŸ¤¦
